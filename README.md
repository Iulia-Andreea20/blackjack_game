# Blackjack Game

# Concepts:
   This is Blackjack that uses the classical rules of the game to generate random numbers between 1 and 14, that represents the value of the cards from a      regular deck of cards.
   The idea is that the sum of the cards generated during the game has to be 21 to win. If the sum is lower than 21, the player can generate a new random      card, otherwise, if It is over 21, the player loses.
